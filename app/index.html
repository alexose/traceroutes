        <div id = "westroxbury">
            <h4>West Roxbury</h4>
                <p>
                    Our traceroute originated in Brookline, so the first stop is the local Comcast hub in West Roxbury.
                    Most consumer Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are Tier 2 providers. This generally means that they operate
                    freely across their own network, but in order to reach other networks, they need to traverse
                    infrastructure that they do not own. They do this by buying IP transit rights or via peering.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Peering refers to the linking of separate networks together so that the users on one network can
                    send traffic across another, and vice versa. This requires the physical exchange of connections via
                    network switches (basically they have to plug in to a common port).

            <h4>Needham</h4>
                <p>
                    After West Roxbury, we end up in Needham. We're still on Comcast's network, because that's the
                    consumer-facing option covering much of Massachusetts. At some point, however, we'll need to connect
                    with a different kind of network, known as a Tier 1 ISP.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Put simply, Tier 1 providers can send traffic to all areas of the Internet without paying for access
                    because they own the most wires. They are the

                <p>
                    Once they make it to New York, Comcast hands our packets off to Level 3, a Tier 1 ISP.
                    Our packets make a few hops in New York, but we're most interested in one of the places it hits
                    before heading across the Atlantic. 60 Hudson Street, in TriBeCa, is a huge facility that acts as
                    the main hub for a huge amount of global internet traffic. From here, our packets will make their
                    way to the fiber optic cable systems that will transport them across the Atlantic Ocean.

                which specific cable our packets traverse, but we do know that Level 3 owns two main
                transatlantic telecoms cables: Atlantic Crossing 1 (AC-1) and Atlantic Crossing 2 (AC-2). Both operate
                between New York and the UK, while AC-2 also makes landfall in the Netherlands and Germany.

                In London, the London Internet Exchange (LINX) is the UK counterpart to 60 Hudson Street. The response
                time for our packets between here and this host is just 100-150 milliseconds, despite traveling across
                thousands of miles of cable. Hundreds of gigabits per second pass through this exchange on their way
                to locations across the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite the high throughput these exchanges can handle, they are vulnerable to unexpected spikes in web
                traffic. Extreme spikes, such as

                The Amsterdam Internet Exchange (AMS-IX) is one of the largest exchanges in the world. It acts as an
                exchange point for traffic headed from all over the world to mainland Europe.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unsurprisingly, the amount of global internet traffic is increasing rapidly. Equally unsurprisingly,

                passing through AMS-IX is also increasing steadily. While there have been concerns about the volume of
                data overwhelming available infrastructure, thus far these concerns don't appear to be validated by the

                Our packets are still within the Level 3 network. In fact, they'll make it all the way to St. Petersburg
                in the same infrastructure owned by the same company. For now, the various stakeholders in the global
                internet exist in an uneasy peace, however the question of who owns and controls the internet will present
                complex challenges in the near future.

        <p>
            <a href = "http://www.unix.com/man-page/linux/8/traceroute/" target="_blank"><b>Traceroute</b></a> (on Unix systems)
            or tracert (Windows) is a tool designed to help analyze the travel path of data across the internet from the
            originating machine to a target server. The command generates a series of packets
            and sends them out across the network to the endpoint selected (usually a website). To get to the endpoint,
            the packets must traverse a series of network nodes, or hosts. At each host, the packets echo information back
            to the originating machine. This process repeats until the last set of packets reaches its final destination.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this case, we're send ing an <a href = "http://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1393.txt" target="_blank"><b>Internet
            Control Messaging Packet (ICMP)</b></a> by using the -I flag in our command.
            The exact science behind an ICMP packet is outside the scope of this application, but for our purposes,
            it’s enough to understand that an ICMP packet contains the originating
            <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc791" target="_blank"><b>Internet Protocol (IP)</b></a>
            address of the packet
            and the destination address. These IP addresses allow each packet to reach its intended destination.
            From a diagnostic perspective, the most important pieces of information are two timestamps; one set
            when the packet is sent from the originating server, and one set when it hits a host.
            Network professionals can use this data to determine if there are any specific nodes in
            the network that are experiencing high latency. Normal people use traceroute to watch data hop across the
            world, because it is cool.

            This is what you would see on your screen at the end of the traceroute. I've condensed the response and

        <h2>Caveats and Credits</h2>
        <p>
            This is a hacky site I put together for school. There are a few pretty major bugs right now (close this and
            click the back button a few times and see what happens), so I make no promises about reliability. This site
            (mostly) works best in Chrome, and it may not work in other browsers. A refresh fixes everything if you find
            yourself stuck.
        </p>
        <p>
            That said, this site uses Foundation 5, for the modals and some styles. If the map looks familiar, that's
            because it comes straight from the Google Maps JavaScript API. Like everyone else who makes things on the
            Internet, I spent copious amounts of time browsing StackOverflow to learn about things I needed to make this
            work.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'd like to thank my colleagues for their feedback during the draft process, especially Parker and Amanda,
            as well as our instructor Tom Akbari. I'd also like to thank my Mom, because you should always thank your
            mother for everything.
